# [RVA](http://codeforamerica.github.io/rva/)

Welcome to Team Richmond's website! This repository serves two purposes. It is a...

1. **website** for the 2015 Richmond, VA Code for America Fellowship Team to document our time spent as fellows and share what we've learned, and a
2. space for us to discuss **our process** as a team in the [issues section](https://github.com/codeforamerica/rva/issues).

It is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you'd like to contribute to our work please follow these [installation instructions](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Jekyll.md).

## Design Biases

* Mobile first
* Keep CSS minimal
* Generally, grayscale first, color later
* Typography is important

## Team Process Principles

* Make things
* Get feedback often
* Do pair designing or programming sometimes
* Testing takes precedence over opinions
* When in a stalemate, defer to a trusted third party, such as someone on the
  tech team.
