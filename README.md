## Design Biases

* Mobile first
* Keep CSS minimal
* Generally, grayscale first, color later
* Typography is important

## Team Process Principles

* Make things
* Get feedback often
* Do pair designing or programming sometimes
* Testing takes precedence over opinions
* When in a stalemate, defer to a trusted third party, such as someone on the
  tech team.
