excerpt: A key part of Code for America’s approach is building rough prototypes quickly so that we can show them to users and get feedback as soon as possible.

  <h1>This is such an awesome title.</h1>
  <p>This is what March looked like. We didn’t travel to Richmond last month, but wanted to post a quick update on our project nonetheless. Code for America’s process has much in common with the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/" target="_blank">US Digital Services playbook</a>, and right now, our team is focused on the first two steps:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Understand what people need.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Address the whole experience, from start to finish.</strong></li>
</ul>
It looks something like this.</p>

    <span class="pre-title">RCHD Resource Center</span>
    Income screening for a pap smear
  </h2>

  <p>Nurses at the Richmond City Health District Resource Centers offer pap smears and other basic services for a sliding scale fee. Patients must submit proof of income to be eligible for lower fees. If an uninsured patient has no doctor, the patient might also be referred to Daily Planet.</p>

  <h2>
    <div class="number"><div class="number-inner">2</div></div>
    <span class="pre-title">Daily Planet</span>
    Income screening for primary care
  </h2>

  <p>Daily Planet screens new patients to determine a sliding scale fee for services. At Daily Planet, an uninsured patient can access oral and eye care, as well as primary care. For specialty referrals, such as orthopedic surgery, a patient would be referred to Access Now.</p>

  <h2>
    <div class="number"><div class="number-inner">3</div></div>
    <span class="pre-title">Access Now</span>
    Income screening for an orthopedist
  </h2>

  <figure class="full"><img src="/img/coverage-chart.svg" id="thing"></figure>

  <p>Access Now maintains a network of volunteer physicians who offer specialty care for the uninsured, such as orthopedists, gynecologists, and gastroenterologists. Before connecting patients with these physicians, Access Now requires screening to verify that the patient is uninsured and low-income.</p>

  <h2>
    <div class="number"><div class="number-inner">4</div></div>
    <span class="pre-title">Bon Secours Community Hospital</span>
    Income screening after a CT scan
  </h2>

  <p>If the specialty care requires using hospital facilities for surgery, CT scans, MRIs, or biopsies, the hospital will screen the patient once again for Medicaid, Medicare, and the hospital’s own charity care programs.</p>

  <p>We spend a lot of time sketching user pathways that represent each step a person might take through this process. Ben draws adorable cartoons that show, for example, a patient applying for the VCC program or a Daily Planet staff member referring a patient to Access Now. This shows us exactly where our understanding of existing workflows is fuzzy and helps us get specific about what we could build.</p>
