<h1>Hi there. We are Team RVA!</h1>

<p>The focus area for the Code for America fellowship in Richmond was healthcare access for people in poverty. During our initial research phase, we heard from patients, case managers, and screening staff that the eligibility screening process at safety-net health services is often a significant barrier to care. Patients struggle to find the necessary income documentation (such as pay stubs or tax returns), and face long waits to fill out an application in person or hear back after mailing one in. They often don’t understand why some people are accepted and others are denied. If they need care from more than one organization, they usually have to start the process from scratch at each one. For a lot of people, it’s easier to just go to the emergency room when they get sick.

<p>We wanted to find ways to make this process more efficient so that patients can get into care faster, and we also wanted to make it less confusing and a better experience for everyone involved. We developed a web application called Quickscreen, which collects the information that’s currently on paper application forms, so that applications can be filled out and submitted from anywhere. With the patient’s permission, their profile in the software is accessible to staff at any of the partners, so that patients won’t have to provide the same information repeatedly. The software estimates a patient’s eligibility at various organizations, so that social workers and community health workers can help patients choose an option that makes sense, and it tracks referrals and screening results over time, so that care providers can see whether their referrals are effective and where else a patient might be receiving care.</p>

<p>We’ve tested the application extensively with mock data. The next step is a pilot with three organizations and a few dozen real patients. At scale, we think this project could make it easier for staff to identify the right clinic or care program for a patient, get the patient through the screening process more quickly, save staff time, and improve patient trust in the healthcare system.</p>
