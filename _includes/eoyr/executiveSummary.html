<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>The Richmond Code for America fellowship focused on healthcare access for people in poverty. During our initial research phase, we heard from patients, case managers, and screening staff that the eligibility screening process at safety-net health services is often a significant barrier to care. Patients struggle to find the necessary income documentation (such as pay stubs or tax returns), and face long waits to fill out applications or receive responses. They often don’t understand why some people are accepted and others are denied. And if they need care from more than one organization, they usually have to start the process from scratch at each one. For many people, it’s easier to go to the emergency room when they get sick.

<p>We wanted to find ways to make this process more efficient so that patients can get into care faster, and we wanted to make it less confusing and a better experience for everyone involved. We developed a web application called Quickscreen, which collects the information currently found on paper eligibility forms, so that applications can be filled out and submitted anywhere. With patients’ permission, their online profile is accessible to staff at partner organizations in Richmond, so that they won’t have to provide the same information repeatedly. The software also estimates a patient’s eligibility at various organizations and tracks referrals and screening results over time.</p>

<p>After extensive tests with mock data, the software is ready for a pilot with a few dozen real patients. At scale, we think Quickscreen will get patients through the screening process more quickly, save staff time, and improve patient trust in the healthcare system.</p>
