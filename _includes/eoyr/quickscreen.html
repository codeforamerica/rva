    <h2 id="qs-background">The Challenge</h2>

    <p>Community health workers in Richmond told us that texting is a convenient way for clients to ask them questions, but they don’t use it much because giving out their personal phone numbers would mean receiving large numbers of texts at all hours. As an experiment, we set up a third party web application called FrontApp for one CHW, Shikita. It allows her to send and receive texts on Front’s website instead of her phone. <blockquote>“one of our coordinators said we can’t track down this patient. All their numbers weren’t working. So we called the clinic but the clinic wasn’t answering their phones. It would be great if we could see the clinic’s records on this person’s phone number.”<span>~ Sanchita Dasgupta, Access Now</span></blockquote>The software also lets her set up auto-replies when she’s out of the office and easily copy-paste answers to common questions. If multiple CHWs are working together, they could give clients a single number and use Front to assign texts to the most appropriate staff member.</p>

    <p>Richmond’s network of low-cost clinics and care programs do great work caring for patients without insurance. But both patients and providers told us that the time and effort required to get an appointment discourages many people from using those services. Funding and clinical capacity are certainly part of the reason for wait times, but we also heard that the application process itself was often slow and frustrating for everyone involved. In order to focus limited resources on those who need it most, almost all safety net providers have an eligibility screening process that determines whether a patient is eligible for free or discounted care (the exception is Care-A-Van, a Bon Secours mobile clinic program). Often, the organization’s funders shape the eligibility criteria and conduct audits, so it’s important to document the decision.</p>

    <h3>How Eligibility Screening Works</h3>

    <p>What kind of information do applications ask for?</p>

    <p><strong>Income</strong>: Providers ask for the patient’s household size and household income and use this to calculate her income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), then compare this to the organization’s cut-off or sliding scale. Asking someone for their household size and income sounds like it should be simple, but there are usually dozens of related questions. Some are used mostly to help staff determine if the answers are consistent. For example, if someone reports a very low income but doesn’t have a high food stamp allotment, it could indicate that another income source is missing. There are also subtly different ways of wording the questions, which could mean the same person answering differently on two forms. For example, the federal definition of “household size” is essentially the number of tax filers plus the number of dependents, but providers try to translate this for people who might not file taxes or might have lower literacy levels. As a result, one form says “people you are financially responsible for” while another says “family members in house.”</p>

    <p><strong>Income documentation</strong>: Screening usually requires patients to show documents that prove their income. This is really the most fundamental requirement (a Code for America team working on an alternative food stamp application process in California decided to eliminate income questions entirely, since they can infer the answers from the income documentation). Pay stubs are the most common choice, but they can be tricky. Sometimes patients haven’t kept two months’ worth of pay stubs because they didn’t think they would need them. Some people don’t have pay stubs because they’re paid under the table. Others work inconsistent hours, so their pay varies widely. Patients can also ask their employers for a letter stating their wages, but some employers will refuse, especially if they hired the patient illegally. If you don’t have any income, you often need a notarized letter from someone who supports you (some services have notary publics on staff, making this easier than we initially imagined). Services work with patients to find something that makes sense--for example, some will accept a signed self-declaration of income if other options are unavailable--but it can be a long process. Some providers use third-party systems like Experian or the Virginia Employment Commission to double-check patients’ employment or income, but they still ask patients to provide documentation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Insurance eligibility</strong>: Providers want to encourage patients who are eligible for insurance to use those benefits, so it’s important to check whether a patient currently has insurance or might qualify for government programs. The requirements can be so complicated, though, that this is not always an easy question to answer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Demographic information</strong>: Some forms also include demographic questions for grant application purposes. These often vary widely among organizations.</p>

    <h3>How does the screening process work right now?</h3>

    <p><strong>It can be slow and confusing.</strong> No two organizations screen in exactly the same way, but here’s an example of a screening process at one primary care clinic:</p>

    <a href="/img/april-comic-full.png">
      <img class="half" src="/img/april-comic-1.png">
      <img class="half" src="/img/april-comic-2.png">
    </a>

    <p><strong>It’s redundant.</strong> If patients visit another provider, they usually have to go through a separate screening, even though the applications ask for most of the same information. A few providers share a form, but most don’t. Here’s an example:</p>
  </div>

  {% include eoyr/redundantScreenings.html %}

  <div class="container">

    <p><strong>What this means.</strong> For care providers, the status quo means spending lots of staff time on screening that could otherwise be spent on something more directly related to patient care. For patients, it means delays getting into care (which can mean that the ER is a better option). And the confusion and frustration damages patients’ trust in the healthcare system. Community members told us that application processes are confusing, it’s hard to get accurate and complete information about eligibility, people don’t understand why their applications are rejected, and it’s demoralizing to have to prove low income again and again.</p>

    <h2 id="qs-goals">Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Decrease the amount of time it takes patients to get through the eligibility screening process.</li>
      <li>Increase patient trust and satisfaction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="qs-application">The Application</h2>
    
    <p>We built a web application that we think can improve this process. Here’s how it works:</p>

    <div class="container" id="lessons">
      <h2 id="qs-lessons">Lessons</h2>

      <p>Despite all of our research, what we built is based on our assumptions, both explicit and implicit, about what users want and need. Only those users can show us which are right and which are wrong, and we wanted to get that feedback early and often so that we could make sure what we built works for them. From May onward, our trips to Richmond focused on showing our prototype application to potential users and letting them navigate through it without too much direction, asking them about their expectations and thoughts at each step.</p>

      <p>We focused on people in three different roles.</p>

    </div>

    {% include eoyr/quickscreenPersonas.html %}

    <div class="container">
      
      <p>Much of the user feedback focuses on UI details. For example, it doesn’t make sense to ask about the spouse’s employment status if the patient isn’t married. Or a dropdown for phone number type (home, cell, work, etc) would be easier than a text field. We want to fix these issues as quickly as possible to eliminate potential pain points. But most important are the big questions: What would you use this for? How does it aid or hinder your goals? What would prevent you from using the software today? What would make you want to start using it immediately?</p>

      <p>Here are a few of the lessons that shaped our thinking the most:</p>

      <h3>HIPAA</h3>

      <p>People are often pretty nervous about projects that involve sharing health data, because they’re concerned about violating HIPAA. We found that this is a hurdle, but not an insurmountable one. We developed a business associate agreement and a patient consent form with the help of a HIPAA-specialist lawyer, and we’re working with a company called Aptible that specializes in HIPAA-compliant web applications to make sure we have all the necessary security features.</p>
      
      <h3>Avoiding double data entry</h3>

      <p>When we showed our prototype to potential users, we realized that their biggest barrier to using it was the potential for duplicate data entry. Some clinics typically have the patient fill out a paper form in the office and then a staff member types all the information into their electronic health record system. If we asked those staff members to then enter the same data into our application as well, we’d be adding a lot of extra work, so it’s important to find ways to either integrate with their existing software or change workflows to avoid duplication.</p>

      <h3>Form variations across organizations</h3>

      <p>One thing we’ve been thinking about a lot is how application forms vary across organizations. For example, this chart shows all the different types of income that organizations might ask about. Some forms ask about food stamps, some ask about social security, one asks you to separate out any income earned as tips. There are hundreds of unique questions, but they’re all really getting at the same thing. As we tried to build a web form that asked all the necessary questions, we talked to our partners a lot about whether all of these questions are really necessary and whether there are ways we could make the forms more similar.</p>

      <h3>Referral and screening result history</h3>

      <p>Community health workers and social workers in Richmond already spend a lot of time referring patients to care programs, but right now, they usually can’t do much more than hand out fliers and encourage the patient to apply. Once it’s online, they can actually get the process started. Those users were really interested in figuring out whether a referral was successful. Did the organization receive the application, and is the patient eligible? And care providers are really interested in knowing where else a patient has been seen, so that they can make sure they’re not duplicating care. This feedback led us to build the referral and screening history page.</p>
      
      <h3>Eligibility information in one place</h3>

      <p>Users were consistently excited by the eligibility estimates because there’s not currently an easy way to compare eligibility criteria across organizations. We think this is really valuable for people making referrals, but it’s only useful if the information can be kept up to date.</p>

      <h2 id="qs-feedback">Feedback</h2>

      <p>After dozens of user research sessions, we’ve received a great deal of qualitative user feedback on both the application and our process. Here are a few of the highlights.</p>

      <p>Users are excited to start using Quickscreen.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I love it, to be honest with you. I need it now. I really do. I need it now.” --Shikita Taylor, Community Health Advocate, RCHD Resource Centers</li>
        <li>“It would allow me to get more information in a more streamlined way to multiple referrals, and I like being able to compare referral options while talking to the patient.”--Kara Weiland, Social Worker, Bon Secours Emergency Department</li>
        <li>“The comment box, I love that part, where we made a comment and they sent a comment back.  Then we don't have to play phone tag.”--Shikita Taylor, Community Health Advocate, RCHD Resource Centers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They think it will have a positive impact.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“You all have planted the seed of possibility, that is a wonderful gift.” --Elizabeth Wong, Access Now</li>
        <li>“This has an intangible benefit. It raises their level of dignity.”--Elizabeth Wong, Access Now</li>
        <li>“If all of the information is already here, we can help [patients] figure out where to go. Instead of them making phone calls, they can get information from the clinics and prevent false starts.”--Shikita Taylor, Community Health Advocate, RCHD Resource Centers</li>
        <li>“I was so excited, one portal where everyone could put their information. It should have been done yesterday, but it’s not.”--Sanchita Dasgupta, Access Now</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The process itself has sparked valuable conversations</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Elizabeth’s quote about the brainstorming session</li>
        <li>One of the other quotes from when we asked about our process</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As the application scales, key metrics might be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of organizations and unique users</li>
        <li>Average number of logins per user per week</li>
        <li>Number of referrals or screening results entered per week</li>
        <li>Staff time required to refer or screen a patient</li>
        <li>Time elapsed between a patient initially seeking care and receiving it</li>
        <li>Patient and staff self-reported satisfaction</li>
        <li>Willingness of organizations to pay for the service</li>
      </ul>
