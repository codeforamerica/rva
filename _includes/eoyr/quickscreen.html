    <h2 id="qs-background">The Challenge</h2>

    <p>Richmond’s network of low-cost clinics and care programs do great work caring for patients without insurance. But both patients and providers told us that the time and effort required to get an appointment discourages many people from using those services. Funding and clinical capacity are certainly part of the reason for wait times, but we also heard that the application process itself was often slow and frustrating for everyone involved. In order to focus limited resources on those who need it most, almost all safety net providers have an eligibility screening process that determines whether a patient is eligible for free or discounted care (the exception is Care-A-Van, a Bon Secours mobile clinic program). Often, the organization’s funders shape the eligibility criteria and conduct audits, so it’s important to document the decision.</p>

    <h3>How Eligibility Screening Works</h3>

    <p>Applications ask for four main types of information:</p>

    <p><strong>Income</strong>: Providers ask for the patient’s household size and household income and use this to calculate her income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), then compare this to the organization’s cut-off or sliding scale. Asking someone for her household size and income sounds like it should be simple, but there are sometimes dozens of related questions.</p>

    <p><strong>Income documentation</strong>: Screening usually requires patients to show documents that prove their income. This is really the most fundamental requirement (a Code for America team working on an alternative food stamp application process in California decided to eliminate income questions entirely, since they can infer the answers from the income documentation). Pay stubs are the most common choice, but they can be tricky. Sometimes patients haven’t kept two months’ worth of pay stubs because they didn’t think they would need them. Some people don’t have pay stubs because they’re paid under the table. Others work inconsistent hours, so their pay varies widely. Patients can also ask their employers for a letter stating their wages, but some employers will refuse, especially if they hired the patient illegally. If you don’t have any income, you often need a notarized letter from someone who supports you.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Insurance eligibility</strong>: Providers want to encourage patients who are eligible for insurance to use those benefits, so it’s important to check whether a patient currently has insurance or might qualify for government programs. The requirements can be so complicated, though, that this is not always an easy question to answer.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Demographic information</strong>: Some forms also include demographic questions for grant application purposes. These often vary widely across organizations. </p>

    <p>The screening process can be slow and confusing. No two organizations screen in exactly the same way, but here’s an example of a screening process at one primary care clinic:</p>

      <img class="half" src="/img/april-comic-1.png">
      <img class="half" src="/img/april-comic-2.png">
    </a>

    <p>It’s also redundant. If patients visit another provider, they usually have to go through a separate screening, even though the applications ask for most of the same information. A few providers share a form, but most don’t. Here’s an example:</p>

    <h3>What this means</h3>
    <p>For care providers, the status quo means spending a great deal of staff time on screening that could otherwise be spent on something more directly related to patient care. For patients, it means delays getting into care (which can mean that the ER is a better option). And the confusion and frustration damages patients’ trust in the healthcare system. Community members think the application process is confusing and demoralizing, and don't understand why some people are denied.</p>

    <h2 id="qs-goals">Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Decrease the amount of time it takes patients to get through the eligibility screening process.</li>
      <li>Increase patient trust and satisfaction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="qs-application">Software</h2>
    
    <p>We built a web application that we think can improve this process. Here’s how it works:</p>

    <div class="container" id="lessons">
      <h2 id="qs-lessons">Lessons</h2>

      <p>Despite all of our research, what we built is based on our assumptions, both explicit and implicit, about what users want and need. Only those users can show us which are right and which are wrong, and we wanted to get that feedback early and often so that we could make sure what we built works for them. From May onward, we spent our trips to Richmond showing our prototype application to potential users and letting them navigate through it without too much direction, asking them about their expectations and thoughts at each step.</p>

      <p>We focused on users in three different roles.</p>

    </div>

    {% include eoyr/quickscreenPersonas.html %}

    <div class="container">
      <p>We also built a patient-facing version of the application, which allows the user to view only her own profile. Unlike the staff version, it hasn't been user tested extensively, but it could be developed further in the future.</p>
      
      <p>Much of the user feedback focuses on UI details. For example, it doesn’t make sense to ask about the spouse’s employment status if the patient isn’t married. Or a dropdown for phone number type (home, cell, work, etc) would be easier than a text field. We fixed those issues as quickly as possible to eliminate potential pain points. But most important were the big questions: What would you use this for? How does it help you meet your goals? What would prevent you from using the software today? What would make you want to start using it immediately?</p>

      <p>Here are a few of the lessons that shaped our thinking the most:</p>

      <h3>HIPAA</h3>

      <p>People are often nervous about projects that involve sharing health data, because they’re concerned about violating HIPAA. We found that this is a hurdle, but not an insurmountable one. We developed a business associate agreement and a patient consent form with the help of a HIPAA-specialist lawyer, and worked with a company called <a href="https://www.aptible.com/">Aptible</a> that specializes in HIPAA-compliant web applications to make sure we have all the necessary security features.</p>
      
      <h3>Avoiding double data entry</h3>

      <p>When we showed our prototype to potential users, we realized that their biggest barrier to using it was the potential for duplicate data entry. Some clinics typically have the patient fill out a paper form in the office and then a staff member types all the information into their electronic health record system. If we asked those staff members to then enter the same data into our application as well, we’d be adding a lot of extra work, so it’s important to find ways to either integrate with their existing software or change workflows to avoid duplication.</p>

      <h3>Form variations across organizations</h3>

      <p>Application forms vary widely across organizations. For example, this chart shows all the different types of income that organizations might ask about.</p>

      <img src="/img/eligibility-review-income-sources.png">

      <p>Some forms ask about food stamps, some ask about social security, one asks you to separate out any income earned as tips. There are hundreds of unique questions, but they’re all really getting at the same thing. As we tried to build a web form that asked all the necessary questions, we talked to our partners about whether all of these questions are really necessary and whether there are ways we could make the forms more similar.</p>

      <h3>Referral and screening result history</h3>

      <p>Community health workers and social workers in Richmond already spend a lot of time referring patients to care programs, but right now, they usually can’t do much more than hand out fliers and encourage the patient to apply. Once it’s online, they can actually get the process started. Those users were really interested in figuring out whether a referral was successful. Did the organization receive the application, and is the patient eligible? And care providers are really interested in knowing where else a patient has been seen, so that they can make sure they’re not duplicating care. This feedback led us to build the referral and screening history page.</p>
      
      <h3>Eligibility information in one place</h3>

      <p>Users were consistently excited by the eligibility estimates because they don't currently have an easy way to compare eligibility criteria across organizations. We think this is really valuable for people making referrals, but it’s only useful if the information can be kept up to date.</p>

      <h2 id="qs-feedback">Feedback</h2>

      <p>After dozens of user research sessions, we’ve received a great deal of qualitative user feedback on both the application and our process. Here are a few of the highlights.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I love it, to be honest with you. I need it now. I really do. I need it now...The comment box, I love that part, where we made a comment and they sent a comment back. Then we don't have to play phone tag...If all of the information is already here, we can help [patients] figure out where to go. Instead of them making phone calls, they can get information from the clinics and prevent false starts.” - <em>Shikita Taylor, Community Health Advocate, RCHD Resource Centers</em></li>
        <li>“It would allow me to get more information in a more streamlined way to multiple referrals, and I like being able to compare referral options while talking to the patient.” - <em>Kara Weiland, Social Worker, Bon Secours Emergency Department</em></li>
        <li>“I was so excited, one portal where everyone could put their information. It should have been done yesterday, but it’s not.” - <em>Sanchita Dasgupta, Input Coordinator, Access Now</em></li>
        <li>“This has an intangible benefit. It raises their level of dignity.” - <em>Elizabeth Wong, Associate Director, Access Now</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>As the application scales, key metrics might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of organizations and unique users</li>
        <li>Average number of logins per user per week</li>
        <li>Number of referrals or screening results entered per week</li>
        <li>Staff time required to refer or screen a patient</li>
        <li>Time elapsed between a patient initially seeking care and receiving it</li>
        <li>Self-reported patient and staff satisfaction</li>
        <li>Willingness of organizations to pay for the service</li>
      </ul>
