<h1>Hi there! We're Team RVA.</h1>
<p>We are a 2015 fellowship team at <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>, a non-profit based in San Francisco that seeks to make government services simpler, more effective, and easier to use. </p>
<p>Our team is working with the city of Richmond, VA and community partners to <strong>improve health care service delivery</strong> for people in poverty.</p>
<p>We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to improving government services. You can contact <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/people/ben-golder/">Ben Golder</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/people/emma-smithayer">Emma Smithayer</a>, or <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/people/sam-matthews">Sam Matthews</a> at <a href="mailto:richmond@codeforamerica.org">richmond@codeforamerica.org</a>.</p>
